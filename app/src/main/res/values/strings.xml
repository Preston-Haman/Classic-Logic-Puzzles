    <string name="cfg_explanation_situation">There are many tellings of this puzzle; but in this case the situation is as follows:
        A Farmer is traveling with a Chicken, a Fox, and a sack of Grain. They come across a \'totally safe\' bridge in their path and do
        not have time to find another way around it. The bridge is pretty rundown; and the Farmer fears crossing it with all their items.
        With no other options, the Farmer decides that they are willing to risk crossing the bridge with one item at a time; however, this
        leaves the Farmer in a predicament. If they leave the Chicken alone with the Grain, the Chicken will eat it! Likewise, if they leave
        the Fox alone with the Chicken, the Fox will eat the Chicken! How can the Farmer safely cross the bridge without losing the Grain or
        the Chicken?</string>
